# ðŸ§© Domain Model â€“ LeafMeAlone

This document defines the data model for **LeafMeAlone**, describing how plants, their environmental states, and their tweets are structured and related.

---

## ðŸŒ± Overview

Each plant in **LeafMeAlone** has:
- A unique ID, name, type, and emoji  
- owner: string â€” identifier for the plant owner
- Environmental data (light and humidity levels)  
- A `lastWatered` timestamp  
- A `condition` reflecting its health status  
- A list of `Tweet` messages generated based on its condition  

Tweets are stored locally (in `localStorage`) for now, and generated every 6 hours when a plant is unhealthy, or manually on demand.

---

## ðŸ§  Type Definitions (TypeScript)

```ts
export type PlantCondition =
  | "healthy"
  | "thirsty"
  | "low-light"
  | "high-humidity"
  | "low-humidity"

export interface Plant {
  id: string
  name: string
  type: string
  emoji: string
  owner: string
  lastWatered: Date
  lightLevel: number // 0â€“100
  humidity: number // 0â€“100
  condition: PlantCondition
  tweets: Tweet[]
}

export interface Tweet {
  id: string
  plantId: string
  message: string
  timestamp: Date
  condition: PlantCondition
}
```

Implementation note: the application classifies a plant as low-humidity when humidity < 40 (percent).
